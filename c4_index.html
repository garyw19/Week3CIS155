		<h2>Our Mission</h2>
		<p>San Joaquin Valley Town Hall is a for-profit organization that is run by the 
			Gary Wallace with an iron fist. My mission is to bring nationally and 
			internationally renowned, thought-provoking speakers who inform, educate, 
			and entertain (and brainwash) my audience! As one or our members told us:</p>
		<blockquote>&ldquo;Each year I give a ticket package to only one of my family members. 
			I think of it as the gift of knowledge...and that is priceless. Which is why I sell them for such great prices!&rdquo;</blockquote>

		<h2>Our Ticket Packages</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Season Package: $950</li>
			<li>Patron Package: $2000</li>
			<li>Single Speaker: $250</li>
		</ul>
